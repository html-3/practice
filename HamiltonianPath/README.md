Have the function `HamiltonianPath(str)` take the `list` of `str` of `tuples` parameter being passed, where the first sublist are the nodes or vertices of the graph, the second sublist are the paths or conections between the vertices, and the last subtist is a set path which could be a Hamiltonian path. The function should return `yes` if the set path is possible and Hamiltonian, else it should return the last valid node of the set path. For example:

 **INSERT EXAMPLE WITH: ["(A,B,C)","(B-A,C-B)","(C,B,A)"]**
