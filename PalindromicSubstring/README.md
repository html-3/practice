Have the function `PalindromicSubstring(str)` take the `str` parameter being passed and return the LPS or longest palindromic substring. A palindrome is a word or string that which reads the same backward as forward. Substring is a string contained within a greater or main string. For example: if the input string is "aneevee" then your program should return the string "eevee".
