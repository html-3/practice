Have the function `PalindromicSubstring(str)` take the `str` parameter being passed and return the LPS or longest palindromic substring. A palindrome is a word or string which is read the same forwards as it is backwards. Substring is a string contained within a greater or main string. 

For example: if the input string is "aneevee" then your program should return the string "eevee". The input will only contain lowercase alphabetic characters.

The input will only contain lowercase alphabetic characters. The longest palindromic substring will always be unique, but if there is none that is longer than 2 characters, return the string none.
